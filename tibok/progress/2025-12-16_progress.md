- Analyzed git status and working tree
- Examined user documentation completeness
- Verified build status

### Documentation Updates

#### Roadmap Enhancements (`tibok/planning/roadmap.md`)
- Updated "Current: Beta v0.6" section with completed features:
  - Plugin System Phase 1
  - Frontmatter Editor (Jekyll/Hugo YAML/TOML)
  - Webhooks (HTTP triggers with templates)
- Added "Before Release" checklist items:
  - KaTeX resource warnings fix
  - QA testing checklist
- Created new "Next: v0.7 - Quick Wins" section with short-term enhancements:
  - Built-in Plugin: Table of Contents Generator
  - Built-in Plugin: Word Count & Reading Time
  - Webhook: Git Commit Event
  - Frontmatter: Blog Post Templates
  - Export: Copy as Rich Text
- Enhanced "Plugin System Phase 2" with detailed tasks:
  - Plugin API versioning
  - Plugin developer documentation
  - Sample plugin templates
- Added new "Plugin System Security & Architecture" section:
  - Sandboxing considerations
  - Permission system design
  - Code signing verification
  - API stability guarantees
  - Migration strategy

#### New Planning Document (`tibok/planning/technical-considerations.md`)
Created comprehensive technical considerations document covering:

**Technical Debt:**
- KaTeX resource warnings (low priority)
- Build system cleanup

**Plugin System Architecture:**
- Phase 1 completion summary
- Phase 2 detailed requirements
- Security & sandboxing strategy (XPC vs App Sandbox)
- Permission system design
- Plugin API versioning approach
- Code signing requirements
- Plugin state migration

**Plugin Developer Experience:**
- SDK requirements
- Developer portal features

**Architecture Strengths:**
- Current wins documented
- Future-proofing strategies
- Performance optimization targets

**Testing Strategy:**
- Current coverage assessment
- Needed test coverage
- QA checklist for v0.6 beta (plugins, webhooks, frontmatter)
- Cross-feature integration tests

**Decision Log:**
- Plugin architecture (compile-time only for Phase 1)
- Frontmatter timezone handling
- Syntax highlighting fix

**Future Considerations:**
- iPad companion app
- Collaborative editing
- Obsidian vault compatibility
- Plugin marketplace

### Current Project State

**Working Tree:** Clean (all changes committed)

**Recent Completions:**
- ✅ Plugin System Phase 1 (enable/disable, state persistence)
- ✅ Frontmatter Editor (YAML/TOML, timezone support)
- ✅ Webhooks (event triggers, template variables)
- ✅ Comprehensive user documentation

**Build Status:** ✅ Compiles successfully
- Minor warnings: KaTeX resources (23 files)
- Fix documented in technical-considerations.md

**Documentation Status:** ✅ Complete
- User docs for all new features
- FAQ updated
- Roadmap current
- Technical considerations documented

### Next Steps

#### Immediate (v0.6 Beta Release)
1. Address KaTeX resource warnings
   - Add `.process("Resources/katex/")` to Package.swift
2. Execute QA testing checklist
   - Plugin lifecycle testing
   - Webhook delivery testing
   - Frontmatter edge cases
   - Cross-feature integration
3. Create CHANGELOG.md entry for v0.6
4. Test build with `./scripts/build-app.sh`

#### Short-term (v0.7 - Quick Wins)
Consider prioritizing:
- Table of Contents Generator plugin (high user value)
- Word Count & Reading Time plugin (commonly requested)
- Git commit webhook event (completes webhook system)

#### Medium-term (v1.0)
Decision point:
- **Option A**: Plugin System Phase 2 (external plugin loading)
  - Benefits: Extensibility, community contributions
  - Complexity: Sandboxing, security, API versioning
- **Option B**: Cloud Sync
  - Benefits: Multi-device workflow
  - Complexity: Conflict resolution, offline support
- **Option C**: Publishing integrations
  - Benefits: Complete Jekyll/Hugo workflow
  - Complexity: GitHub API, authentication

Recommend user feedback survey to guide v1.0 priorities.

### Files Modified
- `tibok/Package.swift` - Fixed KaTeX resource warnings
- `tibok/progress/2025-12-16_progress.md` - This file

### Files Created (Local, not tracked in git)
- `planning/roadmap.md` - Enhanced roadmap with v0.7 quick wins and plugin security details
- `planning/technical-considerations.md` - Comprehensive technical architecture documentation

Note: planning/ and progress/ directories are in .gitignore and not tracked in version control.

### Observations

**Project Health:** Excellent
- Clean codebase
- Well-documented features
- Clear roadmap
- Good separation of concerns

**Recent Work Quality:** High
- Plugin system has solid foundation
- Frontmatter editor is feature-complete
- Webhooks are production-ready
- User docs are thorough and clear

**Areas for Attention:**
1. Testing coverage (currently minimal)
2. Performance profiling (especially for large documents)
3. Plugin API stability planning (before Phase 2)
4. User feedback collection (for feature prioritization)

### Session Summary

Completed comprehensive project review covering:
- Recent development progress
- Documentation status
- Technical architecture
- Planning and roadmap
- Next steps and recommendations

All planning documentation is now current and aligned with project state.
